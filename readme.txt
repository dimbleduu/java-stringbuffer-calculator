a calculator that inputs and outputs a java stringbuilder
I wanted to try making a calculator that would accept and calculate big numbers in detail

currently only accepts positive integer

I haven't done anything to prevent unwanted input yet

type your input in text_file/input1 or text_file/input2
run the code, type in the equations in terminal
the output is in text_file/output



equations :

+ -> addition
* -> multiplication
